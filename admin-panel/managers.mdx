## Workspace Management

### What is a Workspace?

A workspace is a collection of projects. Managers can be assigned to specific workspaces to organize team access.

### Assigning Managers to Workspaces

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or Select Workspace">
    Workspaces are typically created when you set up your account. You can assign managers to existing workspaces.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign Manager">
    When adding or editing a manager, select the workspace from the dropdown.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Access">
    The manager will have access to all projects within the assigned workspace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manager Account Status

### Active Managers

Active managers can:
- Sign in to the admin dashboard
- Access assigned projects and leads
- Perform actions based on their permissions

### Blocked Managers

If a manager is blocked:
- They cannot sign in
- All access is revoked
- They will see a "Blocked" message when attempting to login

<Info>
Managers can be blocked by developers. This is useful for temporary access suspension without removing the account entirely.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Limit access appropriately**: Only grant access to projects and features that managers actually need for their work.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Regular reviews**: Periodically review manager accounts and remove access for team members who no longer need it.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Clear communication**: Inform managers about their access levels and what they can and cannot do.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use workspaces**: Organize projects into workspaces to make manager assignment easier and more logical.
</Tip>
