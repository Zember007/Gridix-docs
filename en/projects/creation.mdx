## Method 1: Import from Excel

Importing from Excel is the fastest way to create a project when you already have data in a spreadsheet.

### Preparing Your Data

Your Excel file should contain the following columns:

| Column | Description | Required | Example |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Apartment Number | Unique apartment identifier | ✅ | 101, 102, A-1 |
| Floor | Floor number | ✅ | 1, 2, 3 |
| Rooms | Number of rooms | ✅ | 1, 2, 3, 4+ |
| Area | Area in square meters | ✅ | 45.5, 68.2 |
| Price | Apartment price | ✅ | 5500000, 7200000 |
| Status | Availability status | ✅ | свободна, продана, забронирована |

<Tip>
Download the template file from the import dialog to ensure proper formatting. The template includes all required columns with example data.
</Tip>

### Import Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Creation">
    In the admin dashboard, navigate to Projects and click "Create New Project".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Import Method">
    Choose "Import from Excel" tab. You'll see two options:
    - **Upload File**: Upload Excel file from your computer
    - **Import by Link**: Connect to Google Sheets via link
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Upload or Link File">
    **For File Upload:**
    - Click "Upload Excel file"
    - Select your .xlsx, .xls, or .csv file
    - Wait for file processing
    
    **For Google Sheets:**
    - Click "By link" tab
    - Paste your Google Sheets link (any format)
    - Gridix will automatically convert and sync
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Map Columns">
    Gridix auto-detects columns, but you can adjust:
    - Review detected column mappings
    - Match your column names to Gridix fields
    - Verify data types
    - Add custom fields if needed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Floor Layout">
    Answer the floor layout question:
    - **Same layout**: Mark apartments once, apply to all floors
    - **Different layouts**: Configure each floor separately
    
    <Info>
    If all floors have the same layout, you'll save significant time during setup.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Data">
    Review the preview of imported data:
    - Check apartment count
    - Verify data accuracy
    - Review any warnings or errors
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Project">
