# Create Your First Project

This guide will help you create your first project in Gridix. You can create projects by importing data from Excel/Google Sheets or by setting them up manually.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A verified Gridix account
- Access to the admin dashboard

## Choosing a Creation Method

Gridix offers two ways to create a project:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Import from Excel/Google Sheets">
    Best for projects with existing data in spreadsheets. Supports:
    - Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
    - CSV files
    - Google Sheets (via link)
    
    <Note>
    Import by link allows automatic synchronization when your spreadsheet updates.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Manual Setup">
    Best for projects you want to configure from scratch. Gives you full control over:
    - Project structure
    - Field configuration
    - Visualization settings
    - Custom properties
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Method 1: Import from Excel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open project creation">
    In the admin dashboard, click "Projects" in the sidebar, then click "Create New Project".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose import method">
    Select "Import from Excel" tab. You can either:
    - Upload a file from your computer
    - Import from Google Sheets using a link
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Prepare your data">
    Ensure your Excel file contains the required columns:
    - Apartment number
    - Floor number
    - Number of rooms
    - Area (in square meters)
    - Price
    - Status (available, sold, reserved, etc.)
    
    <Tip>
    Download our template file to ensure proper formatting: Click "Download Template" in the import dialog.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Upload or link file">
    - **File upload**: Click "Upload Excel file" and select your file
    - **Google Sheets**: Paste your Google Sheets link (any format supported)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Map columns">
    Gridix will detect your columns automatically. Review and adjust the mapping if needed:
    - Match your column names to Gridix fields
    - Verify data types are correct
    - Add any custom fields you need
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure floor layout">
    Answer the question about floor layouts:
    - **Same layout on all floors**: Mark apartments once and apply to all floors
    - **Different layouts**: Configure each floor separately
    
    <Info>
    If layouts are the same, you'll save significant time during setup.
    </Info>
